# Learn F# in x minutes - intro
An attempt at a very terse F# learning list

## 1. Remember: Before you code
1. **[Imutability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object)** by default
2. **[Functions everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming#First-class_and_higher-order_functions#First-class_and_higher-order_functions)** (passed round like values)
3. **[Type Inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference#Nontechnical_explanation)** (annotations usually aren't required)
4. **[Indentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule)** is important (not ```{ }``` for blocks of code)
5. **Whitespace** to seperate arguments (not commas)

## 2. Basics
- [ ] Primitive types (remember: still .NET)
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Tuples
- [ ] Pipelines
- [ ] Composition
- [ ] F# Collection types
- [ ] Record types
- [ ] Discriminated Union types
- [ ] Pattern matching
- [ ] Recursive functions
- [ ] Option types
- [ ] Classes & Interfaces (OOP still exists)
- [ ] Using Computation Expressions (async, result, etc made even easier)

That should cover enough to build apps & have a play. Go out there and build awesome stuff! :) 
Much more to explore when you need it / feel comfortable.

## 3. Learn
### Online REPLs
- [fable.io](https://fable.io/repl/) click samples > tour of F#
- [dotnetfiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/)

### Interactive learning

## 4. Setup locally
1. [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 
2. One of these or your favourite editor with F# support
    - [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
    - [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [ionide](http://ionide.io/) + ([vscode-fsharp-refactor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=danmannock.vscode-fsharp-refactor) optional shameless plug)
